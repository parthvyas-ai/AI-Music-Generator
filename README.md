# AI-Music-Generator
## Acknowledgments
The Maestro dataset's developers and the Google Magenta team's work are expanded upon by the AI-Music-Generator project.  This project would not have been possible without their efforts in creating and curating the dataset.
## Project Overview:
With the use of  LSTM-based neural network to learn musical patterns from a collection of MIDI files and generate new sequences in the style of classical piano music.
Key Concepts:
- MIDI Parsing with music21
- Sequence generation for time series (notes/chords)
- Multi-layer LSTM model with dropout regularization
- Generation of new music and conversion to playable .mid files

## Quick Access
Open in Google Colab - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sKswbTLMzu0SymAylr0AfRQZFBChnN_m?usp=sharing

## Model Architecture
- 3 stacked LSTM layers (512 units each)
- Dropout (0.3) for regularization]
- Dense layer to map to output vocabulary
- Softmax activation to predict next note/chord

## What is MIDI?
MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface, and is the code computers use to read and write music. You can play MIDI files with many applications.

The written-out music looks much more complicated than what the fingers actually do - isn't that the trouble with written-out music! Actually written-out music helps us to train our model, it has two components note and chord.

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

- Open the project notebook in Google Colab.
- Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to configure any necessary settings or parameters.
- Run the code cells in sequential order to execute the project.
- Examine the output and any generated files or visualizations.
